**Platform**: visionOS

**Technologies**: Swift, SwiftUI, REST API, UserDefaults

In BookSight, my first visionOS app you will be able to check for details on every book available on Google Books which is the API that i've used to develop this app. Also, you are able to mark books as favourite and add them to a "shelf" where you are supposed to have the books that you are reading, when those books are in your shelf, you are able to track the progress of them by using a picker located on the bottom ornament as a toolbar.
